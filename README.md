#  ETL Project Two

This is the README for Group 3 ETL Mini Project. Group 3 consist of Robert Dupont, Enrique Garcia, Sierra Morgan, & Logan Woodul. 

The first thing we did was create the category and subcategory DataFrames using the crowdfunding.xlsx. These can be located in the Resources Folder. The code used to execute this is loacted in our jupyter notebook file ETL_Mini_Project_Group3.ipynb. 

The second task was to create a Campaign DataFrame also using the crowdfunding.xlsx. The resulting capaign.csv can be found in the Resources folder. Once again the code is in the Jupyter Notebbok file.

The third task was to create the Contacts DataFrame from the contacts.xlsx. Per the instruction we chose to do Option 1 for this which was using Python dictionary method.The resulting DataFrame is in our Resources folder and is named contacts.csv. Once again the code is in our Jupyter Notebook file. 

The fourth task was to create a ERD sketch using QuickDBD for the four csv files we had created (contacts.csv, category.csv, subcategory.csv, & campaign.csv). This is called ERD.png

Once we had the sketch we could do the final task which was to create the databases. Using pgAdmin we created the Postgres file named crowdfunding_db_schema.sql and the Postgres database. Using the schema we created the four tables (campaign_table.sql, category_table.sql, contacts_table.sql, & subcategory_table.sql).

That was all that was required for ETL Project Two,  
We hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
